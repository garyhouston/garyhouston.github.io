Alas, this isn't *quite* the right answer in this case.  The new Tcl
regexp engine is indeed my work, but it doesn't yet exist as a standalone
*distribution*.  That will be fixed, literally, any day now -- I've been
working on it, intermittently, for some time. 

(You might wonder why it currently exists only as part of Tcl.  The answer
is that Scriptics was willing to support its development, so making it work
inside Tcl was first priority.)

One small complication which will intervene is that the Unicode interface
(in generic/regc_locale.c) is *not* my work -- the folks at Scriptics did
that -- so, at least for now, the standalone distribution will be set up
to talk to such an interface but won't have one included.  I realize that
this should be cured, but it's a significant amount of work and I haven't
found time for it yet.

It's intended to be C++ safe, but I haven't personally tested that.
