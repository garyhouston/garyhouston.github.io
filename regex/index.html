<h1>regex - Henry Spencer's regular expression libraries</h1>
<p>
Henry Spencer wrote three different regular expression libraries. He originally distributed them via Usenet or FTP, but for convenience I have collected them here.
</p>
<hr>
<p>Firstly the "old library" or the "book library". This was originally posted to the Usenet group mod.sources on 19 January 1986 and was updated for the book <i>Software Solutions In C, ed. Dale Schumacher, Academic Press, 1994</i> <a href="https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/usenet-spencer-1993-08-07.txt">[ref: Usenet]</a>. This version was obtained from the ftp server at zoo.toronto.edu (now defunct). The man page is dated 5 September 1996 and original tar archive was dated 4 April 1998.
<p>
The library can be obtained from a <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/regexp.old">github repository</a>, or download <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/regexp.old/archive/master.zip">regex.old-master.zip</a>.

<p>
The second is the "BSD library". This is a POSIX.2 compliant library that was included in 4.4BSD Unix. Spencer wrote that it was basically an alpha release, and pretty slow <a href="https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/usenet-spencer-1993-08-07.txt">[ref: Usenet]</a>. For more information on this library, see the <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/regex/blob/master/README">README</a> and <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/regex/blob/master/COPYRIGHT">COPYRIGHT</a> files and the man pages <a href="https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/regex3.html">regex(3)</a> and <a href="https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/regex7.html">regex(7)</a>. This version was also obtained from zoo.toronto.edu and is dated 10 August 1999.
<p>
The library can be obtained from a <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/regex">github repository</a>, or download from the <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/regex/releases">release archives</a>. The alpha3.8 release is the code obtained from zoo.toronto.edu, while subsequent releases contain bug fixes.
<p>
I have also prepared a shared library version, using Autoconf etc., to allow installation as a system library in Linux or similar systems. See the <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/rxspencer/blob/master/WHATSNEW">WHATSNEW</a> page for details of changes.
<p>
This version also has a <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/rxspencer">github repository</a>, or download <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/rxspencer/archive/alpha3.8.g5.tar.gz">rxspencer-alpha3.8.g5.tar.gz</a> (December 15, 2013).

<p>
The third is the "Tcl library", which was added to <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">Tcl</a> in 1999 (version 8.1) and supports wide-character Unicode. Although Spencer was working on packaging this library as a standalone distribution <a href="https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/usenet-spencer-1999-09-20.txt">[ref: Usenet]</a>, as far as I know he never released it.
<p>
However, a couple of ports are available. Walter Waldo made a C++ library, which can be obtained from a <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/hsrex">github repository</a>, or download <a href="https://github.com/garyhouston/hsrex/archive/master.zip">hsrex-master.zip</a>. Documentation is somewhat lacking for this library, but here's a basic example for the ASCII version: <a href="https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/hsrex-char.c">hsrex-char.c</a>. The Tcl library documentation may also be useful.
<p>
There's also a <a href="https://github.com/basis-technology-corp/tcl-regex-java">Java port</a> by Basis Technology Corporation available in github.
