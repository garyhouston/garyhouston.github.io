In fact, there are at least two more, because I wrote them both. :-)

There's my old package, dating back to 1986 or thereabouts, which is in
widespread use (including several commercial products -- it helps that
its copyright terms are much more liberal than the GNU ones).  A slightly
updated version of that will appear in a few months, in conjunction with
a new book -- Software Solutions In C, ed. Dale Schumacher, Academic
Press -- which will have a chapter (by me) that walks through the code
explaining how it works.  Meanwhile, you can find the old code lots of
places, including zoo.toronto.edu/dtr/regexp.shar .

Then there's my new one, which is the regular-expression implementation
shipping with 4.4BSD.  The good news is that it's completely POSIX.2
compliant.  The bad news is that it's pretty slow; it's basically an
alpha release, and I'd really hoped to get at least to a beta before
4.4 shipped, but that didn't happen.  Eventually there will be a faster
release, but don't ask me to set a date just yet.
